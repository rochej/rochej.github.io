      <h2>Arrays and Hashes - 12/04/2015</h2>
      <p>Arrays and hashes are two different ways to structure data in Ruby.  An array is an ordered/indexed list, and a hash is an unordered list where each item is a key:value pair.  Here’s an example of when a hash might be preferable to an array.
      <p>Sue is a DJ for AAA baseball.  It’s her job to provide the soundtrack for the game—from playing the classic organ music to all of the players’ favorite songs.  Her predecessor, Mike, had all of the players’ favorite songs organized in an Array.</p>
      <code>song_array=[“Welcome to the Jungle”, “We Will Rock You”, “Eye of the Tiger”, “Spice Up Your Life”, “Bring Em Out”, “Stronger”, “Seven Nation Army”, “Start Me Up”, “Roar”]</code>
      <p>Unfortunately, that meant that a player coming up to bat might hear their favorite song, but they could end up getting someone else’s.</p>
      <p>Sue is the type of DJ who’s always looking to improve systems, so she instead organizes the favorite songs in a Hash.  That way, she can search a player’s favorite song to blast when they come up to the plate.</p>
      <code>song_hash={“Avery” : “Welcome to the Jungle”, “Jordan” : “We Will Rock You”, “Morgan” : “Eye of the Tiger”, “Riley” : “Spice Up Your Life”, “Shane” : “Bring Em Out”, “Logan” : “Stronger”, “Hayden” : “Seven Nation Army”, “Carson” : “Start Me Up”, “Devin” : “ Roar”}</code>
      <p> For example, when Riley comes up to the plate, Sue tries...</p>
      <code>puts song_hash["Riley"]</code>
      <p>...and plays Spice Up Your Life.  The crowd goes wild, and the players’ batting averages improve 40%.  Winning!</p>
