<!--
*How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?
Wireframing with a pair was fine.  I don't know that either of us were mindblown with our result, but collaborating during the creative process is not always super fruitful.  I prefer co-editing to co-creating.  Creating the HTML page with my pair was super.  We both contributed ideas that more fully utilized HTML5's semantic specificity.
*Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?
Definitely!  Even if I was not formally wireframing, I'd be imagining what the layout would eventually look like.  Wireframing solidified the HTML's destination.
*What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe?
We kept it pretty simple but wanted to make sure all the info was there.
*What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any)?
I did not learn about any new semantic elements, but my pair had the brilliant idea of making the links to other blog posts in the navigation bar an unordered list, which I think looks great!
