      If only I had known about a tool like GitHub 3 years ago when my dance company, vîv, started writing grants.  The thing about writing grants is that each grant application has subtle differences from all the others.  Although the grant-maker essentially wants to find out why you’re deserving of ca$h, they also want to make sure that you give a $h!t about them, so they ask their questions in their own special way to confirm you’re paying attention.  Each time vîv writes a new grant application we take the previous one, make a copy and edit to supply the details requested in the particular application.  After 3 years of doing this, I often feel like I’m writing the same grant over and over again in different configurations!  If only we had used a tool like GitHub to collaboratively edit our grant applications!!!  (Not that I can get dancers to use fancy online tools—some of my company members are still using flip phones…)  Each set of updates we made over the years would have been carefully labeled and attributed to its author.  When reviewing a new application, we could have looked back to previous versions and decided which ones would make sense to apply, leaving the majority of the application intact from grant to grant.  I can only dream about the hours of hassle and the countless back-and-forths this would have saved us…time we could have spent dancing!

        As you may have gathered, GitHub is a community focused project vault and version control system.  You can store your project (most frequently code) on GitHub,  and then save changes (called commits) as you go.  Each commit is identified with the authors handle, the time and a description.  (My Virgo self just loves this.)  The magic starts to happen when you save your project publicly, allowing other brilliant minds to review and suggest updates to the project you’ve begun.  One of the things I appreciate about the inner workings of GitHub is that it’s not a total free-for all.  Although you may be inviting collaboration and other’s viewpoints, they cannot update the master project without the owner’s permission.  It’s a fantastic example of a functional nonhierarchical collaboration.

       I was so impressed with that last phrase that I just turned that I decided to Google “functional nonhierarchical collaboration” and see what other philosophers think about how it manifests on GitHub.  The first hit was an article from the Brooking’s Institute on <a href=“http://www.brookings.edu/blogs/techtank/posts/2015/01/15-github-government-collaboration”>Overcoming Barriers to Governmental Collaboration </a>.  The authors give a case study regarding how GitHub might function in editing governmental policy documents, then they wax poetic about how this kind of transparent collaboration could shift the fundamental nature of government.  Reading these authors’ imaginings sheds light on part of why I’m so impressed with GitHub.  It takes humility and generosity to take work that others have done, look deeply enough to understand its essential nature, contribute to its excellence and then simply share it with anyone who is interested.  It’s a beautifully human act, and one that I’m looking forward to participating in.
