      <h2>Stay Classy - 12/16/2015</h2>
        <p>Classes are a powerful way to organize objects that share characteristics.  In Ruby, classes can inherit methods from one (and only one) parent class and have multiple child classes.</p>

        <p>In today’s example, I will begin to create a Ruby program that can replace me as a yoga teacher while I attend DBC.</p>

        <p>First, we have the parent class Movement_Class.  We could use this for a ballet class, a bootcamp class or any other type of instructor led movement experience.  All classes mush have an initialize method that allow you to create a new object of that class--for our Movement_Class, the only parameter/prerequisite for taking a Movement Class is that you have a body—no computers allowed.  We also define a method in the parent class called howd_it_go?—since any class is ALWAYS classy, that’s what it puts.</p>


<pre><code>class Movement_Class
  def initialize (body)
    @body=body
    if @body
      puts "You're looking well today!"
    else
      raise ArgumentError.new ("Must have body to take class!")
    end
  end

  def howd_it_go?
    puts "As always, class was classy : )"
  end
end</code></pre>

        <p>Next we define Yoga_Class, which is a subclass of Movement_Class.  Yoga_Class takes an argument, advanced, that is either true or false.  This becomes an instance variable (demarcated by the @)—it’s available throughout the class and interacts with other methods.  For example, in our .instruction method, our advanced students jump forward and back 8 times, but our non-advanced students only do it 1 time.</p>


<pre><code>class Yoga_Class < Movement_Class
  def initialize (advanced)
    @advanced=advanced
    if @advanced
      @rounds=8
    else
      @rounds=1
    end
  end

  def begin
    if @advanced
      puts "Ready for inversions?  Let's go!"
    else
      puts "OK--let's start in child's pose."
    end
  end

  def instruction
    @rounds.times do
      puts "Jump forward.  Now jump back."
    end
    puts "Well done EVERYONE!"
  end
end</code></pre>

    <p>Now we can try out our program with the following commands:</p>


<pre><code>level2 = Yoga_Class.new(false)
level2.begin
level2.instruction
level2.howd_it_go?</code></pre>

    <p>This returns the beginnings of a revolution in fitness...!</p>
    <p>=> OK--let's start in child's pose.<br>
=> Jump forward.  Now jump back.<br>
=> Well done EVERYONE!<br>
=> As always, class was classy : )</p>
