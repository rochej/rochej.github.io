      <h2>Optimizing SQL Queries--Who Cares?!? - 01/07/2016</h2>
<p>Honestly, after reading a bit about it, I do!</p>

<p>When my friends outside of DBC ask me how school is going, I tell them that I’ve basically just mastered the art of making scrambled eggs.  What I am able to do is functional but VERY basic.  I’m working so hard to master the basics, that fancy things like optimizing for speed feel a little overwhelming.  However, after reading a bit about Optimizing SQL Queries, I’m intrigued!  Processing time may seem negligible when making scrambled eggs, but for a soup to nuts fine dining experience chef skills are important.</p>

<p>The one tip that everyone on the internets seems to propose to optimize SQL queries is INDEXING.</p>

<p>Imagine that you wanted to make French Onion Soup—you have all the ingredients, but you do not have the internet to lookup a recipe!  What to do?!?  Fortunately, you have The Joy of Cooking.</p>

<p>Scenario 1: Unfortunately, the pages have been ripped out of the binding and scattered all over your kitchen.  Hard to find the French Onion Soup recipe—and what it the recipe is on two pages?  It will take hours just to find the recipe!  Never mind—scrambled eggs for dinner…again.</p>

<p>Scenario 2:  Cookbook, though food stained is intact.  You open to the index, find letter “F”, find “Fr” and there’s your recipe.  Now, onto soup making.</p>

<p>Now you can understand why indexes are important!  SQL indexes are somewhat different than cookbook indexes—and in fact they can be custom created for particular datasets and queries.</p>

<p>Let’s say we wanted to create a custom index on our Joy of Cooking to find recipes that we used regularly.  We make soup a lot, so rather than looking through all the index entries for all of the recipes that contain the word soup, we copy the soup recipes and page numbers to an index card and stick it in the back of our cookbook.  Much simpler and easier to find our favorite soups(and so helpful that many cookbooks do in fact organize their indexes in this way).</p>

<p>We also like making cookies…and bread..and fondue…and waffles…and dumplings…  Oh no!  Now we have all these silly index cards falling out of the back of our cookbook!  Apparently, many novice SQL database managers over-index their databases, which destroys the time-saving benefits of the indexes in the first place.  Indexes are to be designed to assist with the most frequent and arduous queries—not just for the rare fondue party.</p>
