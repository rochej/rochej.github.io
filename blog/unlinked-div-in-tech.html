      <h2>Diversity in Tech  - 12/01/2015</h2>
      <p>I spent the last week of my senior year at University of Michigan huddled in blankets, studying my dad’s 1970s college accounting textbook.  As an aspiring professional dancer, I knew I would need a dayjob— bookkeeping would be a great way to pay my rent while I pursued my career in dance.  A month later, I was living in NYC, auditioning for dance companies and working for Alpha Graphics as their part-time bookkeeper.  In my 10 year career as a bookkeeper, I have only been asked twice if I had a degree or certificate in finance, and both times I got the job.</p>

<p>What does this have to do with diversity in tech?</p>

<p>It is not news that tech is not diverse.  Check out the <a href=“http://graphics.wsj.com/diversity-in-tech-companies/”>WSJ’s statistics</a> for more details.</p>

<p>In the grand history of jobs, software development is a relatively new option, and its image is largely in the hands of its practitioners.  Read any internet article about coding bootcamps or online programs and you’ll see the comment section full of CS grads proclaiming that a 4 year program is the only way to be a real programmer.  Programming is REALLY HARD and the folks who do is are VERY SPECIAL.  Honestly, when I read their opinions, I am frightened and doubt my choices.  Perhaps they’re right—that this career will be too challenging for me—that I am unprepared to work in the field.  Their image of the profession feels exclusive (or like an ego trip), rather than welcoming.</p>

<p>So I remind myself—like any field, there are levels of expertise and specialization.  As a bookkeeper, when confronted with a challenging questions, I ask an accountant.  I am not an accountant, I am a a bookkeeper.  If I wanted to be an accountant, I’d study on weekends and take some certification tests.  My impression is that that same is true for programming—there’s work for advanced beginners and there’s work for experts and all the work needs to be done.</p>

<p>I know that 18 weeks of studying programming will is only a beginning…but that’s the point.  It’s a beginning!  And without supporting lower stakes ways for  ANY interested person to enter the field, it will remain exclusively the purview of the privileged.  Just giving people a taste of programming is enough to take the edge off.  Electives in schools could go a long way to make programming feel accessible rather than mysterious and unapproachable.</p>

<p><em>Many wise people have written about diversity in tech and there are wonderful organizations (such as <a href=“http://www.blackgirlscode.com/“>Black Girls Code</a>) who are doing important work bringing more women and POC into the world of tech.  My particular angle on this conversation is more <a href=“http://www.npr.org/sections/money/2014/10/21/357629765/when-women-stopped-coding”>psychosocial</a> than about allocation of resources.</em></p>
