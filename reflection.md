* What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?
I had worked with these concepts in the past, but it was nice to remember which is which (with margins=outside, padding=inside) and to get to use them to format my site.

* What did you learn about CSS positioning?
I basically only used relative positioning for this challenge.  It seems that is the way to go these days, with all the different screen sizes.  I generally find fixed positioning kind of annoying--like get out of my sight, element.  Absolute and static would be helpful in a communist republic where everyone had the same computer and I could design the spaceing to a T.

* What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?
Before this excercise, I did not know how challenging it was to vertically align anything in the center using CSS.  When I googled it, I saw many designers bemoaning this shortfall of CSS.  There are still some strange overlaps that I am trying to figure out.
Working with color was super fun and satisfying.

* What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?
It was interesting to experience firsthand how challenging fluid design can be.  What looks wonderful fullscreen is awkward in half-screen, etc.  The float command was new to me, as was the clear command, and I still have a lot to learn about formatting images using CSS.
